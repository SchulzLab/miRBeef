# miRBeef
This repo contains accompanying code for the miRBeef benchmarking approach.

CLIP-L processed data would soon be available on Zenodo: 

The data contains two subfolders: CLIP-L_raw and CLIP-L_homology. Each folder contain the miRNA and mRNA site interactions with the label 1 or 0.
The interaction in CLIP-L_raw are processed CLEAR-CLIP, CLASH and qCLASH experiments. CLIP-L_homology contains interactions annotated as Homology (H) or Non-homology (NH).

The CLIP data is from miTAR [1]
